# hop.fun decompiled contract

hop.fun's v2 contract, decompiled by hand from bytecode.
I only used public data to rebuild the contract.

**ATTENTION! THE CONTRACT MIGHT NOT BE FINAL AND MIGHT WANT CHANGES, LOOK AT THE BYTECODE YOURSELF IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO FORK**

will be updating the contract in every update.
