# hop.fun decompiled contract

hop.fun's v1 contract, decompiled by hand from bytecode.
I only used public data to rebuild the contract.

**ATTENTION! THIS CONTRACT INCLUDES A BUG WHERE INDEXER CANNOT INDEX METADATA BECAUSE THEY WRAP IT ON CONNECTOR FIRST. THIS CONTRACT NEEDS UPDATE IF YOU WANT TO USE IT.**

will be updating the contract in every update.
